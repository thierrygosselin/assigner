\usage{
install_gsi_sim(
  commit = "080f462c8eff035fa3e9f2fdce26c3ac013e208a",
  fromSource = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{commit}{The full SHA-1 hash from GitHub from which to get
the binary or source}

\item{fromSource}{If TRUE, download source, even if a binary is available.
If FALSE, then it will download a precompiled binary, if available.  If a 
binary is not available, then it will attempt to download the source.}
}
\description{
If the system is Mac, or Windows, this function will
download a precompiled binary from GitHub.  In other cases, or
if fromSource == TRUE, this function will attempt to download
the source code and compile the program from source and install 
it.
}
\details{
If this function fails, then you can just compile gsi_sim by
going to GITHUB_URL and compiling it yourself and naming the
executable gsi_sim and putting it at the location specified by the
function \code{\link{gsi_sim_binary_path}}.
