`purrr:dfr`. Changed `DESCRIPTION` field accordingly.


# assigner 0.5.0 2017-12-12

* `subsample` argument in `assignment_ngs` and `assignment_mixture` can now 
automatically detect the smallest sample size in the data's grouping. So you can
use `subsample = "min"` to let the function decide (if your not sure).


# assigner 0.4.9 2017-08-18

* migration of `assigner` from using `stackr` -> `radiator`


# assigner 0.4.8 2017-08-15

* restored progress bar when using parallel computing by installing the new dev
version of `pbmcapply` package.


# assigner 0.4.7 2017-08-15

* bug fix: removed the progress bar when using parallel computing. This is temporary, while waiting for a fix with `pbmcapply` package.

# assigner 0.4.6 2017-06-17

* **assigner** works with `dplyr v.0.7.0`

# assigner 0.4.5 2017-04-25

calculation are resolved.

# assigner 0.4.4 2017-04-12

* bug fix in `assignment_ngs` introduced in last commit that was suppose to be
fix. Problem introduced by `stackr::change_pop_names`.

# assigner 0.4.3 2017-04-02

* it's now official, `assigner` as a logo
* faster `fst_NEI87`
* unbalanced design impact on estimates can be tested with `subsample` and
`iteration.subsample` in `fst_NEI87` and `fst_WC84`

# assigner 0.4.2

* until `SNPRelate` [bias issue](https://github.com/zhengxwen/SNPRelate/issues/21)
is resolved the option is unavailable
* better use of `pbmcapply` for Windows
* **imputations** is being reworked and will be buggy until the next update. The
codes are being completely re-written and arguments will change (for the better).


# assigner 0.4.1

* debug code to work in parallel with Windows
* code cleaning to prep for CRAN


# assigner 0.4.0

* `assignment_ngs` and `assignment_mixture` code cleaning to prep for CRAN and
make them easier to debug.

# assigner 0.3.9
* I'm pleased to announce that `assigner` now works in parallel with **Windows**
* bug fix introduce in last commit in `write_gsi_sim` where the file was not
created properly from an internal module.

# assigner 0.3.8
* `assigner::fst_WC84` can now use [SNPRelate](https://github.com/zhengxwen/SNPRelate)
to compute Fst. The confidence intervals are not implemented, yet.
The speed increase left me speechless, dataset with 30K snp are computed in less than 15 sec!


# assigner 0.3.7
* `assigner::fst_WC84` is 40% faster!

# assigner 0.3.6
* bug fix `assignment_ngs` during imputations, the imputation module could not
recognise that REF/ALT alleles are not necessary or usefull for assignment analysis.
*enhancement to `assignment_ngs` and `assignment_mixture` so that when 
`marker.number` include `"all"` the `iteration.method` is set automatically to `1`
when conducting the assignment with all the markers.
Iterations at this point is useless and a waist of time.
* random seed number is now stored in the appropriate files.
* `assignment_mixture`: with `assignment.analysis = "gsi_sim` the unknown/mixture samples
are compared with baseline populations using common markers between the pair.
Now, the tables include the number of markers used. The summary provides the mean
number of markers. This number will change each time randomness is used.

# assigner 0.3.5
* bug fix in population not recognise properly

# assigner 0.3.4
* `fst_NEI87`: very fast function that can compute: the overall and pairwise Nei's (1987) fst and f'st (prime). 
Bootstrap resampling of markers is avalaible to build Confidence Intervals. The estimates are available as a data frame and a matrix with upper diagonal filled with Fst values and lower diagonal filled with the confidence intervals. Jost's D is also given ;)

# assigner 0.3.3
* `fst_WC84`: bug fix, the function was not properly configured for multi-allelic markers (e.g. microsatellite, and haplotype format from STACKS). Thanks to Craig McDougall for catching this.


# assigner 0.3.2
* `assignment_mixture`: added a check to throw an error when pop.levels != the pop.id in strata

# assigner 0.3.1
`assignment_mixture`: 
  * updated with latest modules from `stackr`. 
* simplified the identification of mixture or unknown samples. See doc.


# assigner 0.3.0
* updated vignettes
* major bug fix that involved dplyr new version (0.5.0) and mostly with 
the use of dplyr::distinct


# assigner 0.2.9
* updated vignettes
* bug fix in `fst_WC84`
* bug fix between assinger -> devtools -> github -> travis, [this page helped] (http://itsalocke.com/using-travis-make-sure-use-github-pat/)


# assigner 0.2.8

* While changing some lines with `tidyr::spread` and `tidyr::gather` for `data.table::dcast.data.table` and `data.table::melt.data.table` to make the code faster, I forgot to split genotype into alleles for `gsi_sim`.
* please update both **stackr** and **assigner**
  * the build error from Travis will be fixed soon. 
It should not affect the package "experience"" in any way.

# assigner 0.2.7

* you need to update [stackr] (https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr) to v.0.2.7
to appreciate this new version of assigner.

* updated `assignment_ngs` with the separate stackr modules to simplify the function.

* new data file available for `assignment_ngs`: `genepop` and `genind` object.

* `assignment_ngs` now accept any vcf input file! i.e. itâ€™s no longer limited to stacks vcf. 

* new arguments in `assignment_ngs`. The assignment using dapc can now use 
the optimized alpha score `adegenet.dapc.opt == "optim.a.score"` or 
the cross-validation `adegenet.dapc.opt == "xval"`. This is useful for fine tuning 
the trade-off between power of discrimination and over-fitting 
(for stability of group membership probabilities).
Cross validation with `adegenet.dapc.opt == "xval"` doesn't work with 
missing data, so it's only available with *imputed data* 
(i.e. `imputation.method == "rf" or "max"`). 
With non imputed data or the default: the optimized alpha-score is used 
(`adegenet.dapc.opt == "optim.a.score"`).
When using `adegenet.dapc.opt == "xval"`, 2 new arguments are available: 
(1) `adegenet.n.rep` and (2) `adegenet.training`. See documentation for details.

* removed arguments in `assignment_ngs`. Removed the `pop.id.start` and `pop.id.end`
arguments that were confusing people. For those used to these arguments, 
they are now recycled in the new function `individuals2strata`
in [stackr] (https://github.com/thierrygosselin/stackr). 
The strata file created by this function can be used with the `strata` argument in
`assignment_ngs`.

* 2 modified arguments in `assignment_ngs`: (1) `gsi_sim.filename` is now `filename`; and 
(2) if you didn't use the imputation argument, replace `imputation.method = FALSE`
to `imputation.method = NULL` or leave the argument missing.

* simplified sections of codes in `assignment_ngs` that dealt with `strata`, 
`pop.levels` and `pop.labels`.

* new function: `write_gsi_sim`. Write a gsi_sim file from a data frame (wide or long/tidy). 
Used internally in [assigner] (https://github.com/thierrygosselin/assigner)
and might be of interest for users.

# assigner 0.2.6

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* `fst_WC84` is now a separate and very fast function that can compute: the overall and pairwise Weir and Cockerham 1984 Theta/Fst. Bootstrap resampling of markers is avalaible to build Confidence Intervals (For Louis Bernatchez and his students;). The estimates are available as a data frame and a matrix with upper diagonal filled with Fst values and lower diagonal filled with the confidence intervals.

# assigner 0.2.5
* cleaner code for strata section
* bug fix restricted to `assignment_ngs` + `assignment.analysis = "adegenet"` + `sampling.method = "ranked"`.
A line at the beginning of a gsi_sim code section was deleted makig the assignment with adegenet go through that chunk of code and causing 100% assignment! if (assignment.analysis = "gsi_sim") {code} prevent this problem...

# assigner 0.2.4
* bug fixed using adegenet that was introduced in v.0.2.3
* introducing a new function `import_subsamples_fst` to import the fst ranking 
results from all the subsample runs inside an assignment folder.

# assigner 0.2.3
* bug fixed in the compilation results section when no pop.id.start and end are used.

# assigner 0.2.1
* updated the function `assignment_mixture` with `sampling.method = "ranked"` and 
`assignment.analysis = "adegenet"`.

# assigner 0.2.0
* new function: `assignment_mixture` for mixture analysis.

# assigner 0.1.9
* Simplified gsi_sim install

# assigner 0.1.8
* You can now opt between [gsi_sim] (https://github.com/eriqande/gsi_sim) or [adegenet] (https://github.com/thibautjombart/adegenet), a R package developed by Thibaul Jombart, to conduct the assignment analysis

# assigner 0.1.7
* New input file: Re-introduced the haplotype data frame file from stacks.
* Argument name change: `imputations` is now `impute.method`.
* New argument: `impute` with 2 options: `impute = "genotype"` or `impute = "allele"`.

# assigner 0.1.6
* Input file argument is now `data` and covers the three types of files the 
function can use: VCF file, PLINK tped/tfam or data frame of genotypes file.
* Huge number of markers (> 50 000 markers) can now be imported in PLINK 
tped/tfam format. The first 2 columns of the `tfam` file will be used for the 
`strata` argument, unless a new one is provided. Columns 1, 3 and 4 of the 
`tped` are discarded. The remaining columns correspond to the genotype in the 
format `01/04` where `A = 01, C = 02, G = 03 and T = 04`. For `A/T` format, use 
PLINK or bash to convert. Use [VCFTOOLS] (http://vcftools.sourceforge.net/) with 
`--plink-tped` to convert very large VCF file. For `.ped` file conversion to 
`.tped` use [PLINK] (http://pngu.mgh.harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/) with
`--recode transpose`.

# assigner 0.1.5
* bug fix in `method = "random"` and `imputation`

# assigner 0.1.4
* Changed function name, from `GBS_assignment` to `assignment_ngs`. Stands for
assignment with next-generation sequencing data.
* New argument `df.file` if you don't have a VCF file. See documentation.
* New argument `strata` if you don't have population id or other metadata info 
in the individual name.  See documentation.

# assigner 0.1.3
* Changed arguments `THL` to `thl` and `snp.LD` to `snp.ld` to follow convention.
* `iterations.subsample` changed to `iteration.subsample`.
* `iterations` changed to `iteration.method` to avoid confusion with other iteration arguments.
* Removed `baseline` and `mixture` arguments from the function `GBS_assignment`.
These options will be re-introduce later in a separate function.
* Using `marker.number` higher than the number of markers in the data set was causing
problems. This could arise when using arguments that removed markers from the dataset
(e.g. `snp.ld`, `common.markers`, and `maf` filters).

# assigner 0.1.2
* new version to update with gsi_sim new install instruction for Linux and Mac.
After re-installing assigner package, follow the instruction to re-install 
the new [gsi_sim] (https://github.com/eriqande/gsi_sim). 
And delete the old binary 'gsisim' in the /usr/local/bin folder
with the following Terminal command: `sudo rm /usr/local/bin/gsisim`
