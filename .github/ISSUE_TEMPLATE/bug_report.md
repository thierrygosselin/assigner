I cannot help you if I cannot reproduce the problem.
Consequently, when reporting an issue, make sure to include:

A clear and concise description of what the bug is.

**To Reproduce**
Include the steps to reproduce the behavior:
* the exact command (function, arguments, values) used
* the complete error message you're getting
* the output of `devtools::session_info()`
* complete data required to reproduce the problem, a subset of it. The data remains confidential.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots to help explain your problem.
